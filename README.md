# Transfer-file-server

yep, another basic lan file server with QRcode in terminal and fast Copy-Paste note.

this was a way to improve my Golang knowledge in the quarantine. And also it's a tool that i use at home to transfer files or copy-paste text.

There are probably better projects that do the same thing, but if you like it, you are free to use it and do whatever you want with it.
